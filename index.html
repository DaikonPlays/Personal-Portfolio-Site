            <p class="left-aligned right-shifted">Welcome to my page! I'm a third year Computer Engineering Major <br> with a Business 
               minor at the University of California, San Diego. <br> Passionate about the intersection of technology and innovation, <br>
               I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field. <br><br>
               At UCSD, I have completed numerous high-level classes, including:
               <ul class="left-aligned right-shifted">
                <li>Java Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
                <li>Mathematical Algorithms in C.S.</li>
                <li>C programming</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>C++ Data Structures</li>
                <li>Components and Design Techniques for Digital Systems</li>
                <li>Advanced Software Engineering</li>
            </ul>   
            </p>
            <p class="left-aligned right-shifted">
                that has led me to have an advanced understanding of computer programming.<br><br>
                I also have experience in software engineering through my current internship at Mutual of Enumclaw.<br>
                Here, I work on both front-end and back-end development using a multitude of skills, <br>
                including web development with Angular, C#, and more. This experience has helped <br>
                me learn not just corporate-level programming assignments, but also how to work as a team.<br>
                within a department. <br>
